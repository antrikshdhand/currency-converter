<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Currency Converter][product-screenshot-2]

Created for Project 1 in SOFT2412: Agile Software Development Practices, the Currency Converter project delivers a manually-administrated currency exchange program. 

Created in Java 17 using `java.swing` for the GUI, the currency exchange allows users to:

- convert between various currencies
- view current exchange rates of popular currencies, and 
- view historical exchange rate data

Admins of the application are responsible for setting which currencies are popular and adding and updating currencies and their exchange rates. All data is persistant and is stored in a local SQLite database.
